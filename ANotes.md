**Learning from Last year:**

1. Book losses if you can, that could bring down the taxable amount by 3000 USD
2. Aptive, this was a immature and compulsive decision taken when the salesman was at our door. Costed us approximately 400 USD.
3. Try not to book tickets through Europe / Canada they do have restrictions on expired H1B and no VISA stamping.
4. You can do better tax savings, if you put your money towards retirement, in that calendar year.

Example for distinct

Example 9: Creating a Sub List by Copying distinct values 
This example shows how you can take advantage of a distinct() method of Stream class to filter duplicates in Collection.

// Create List of square of all distinct numbers
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(9, 10, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4);
List<Integer> distinct = numbers.stream()
                                      .map( i -> i*i)
                                      .distinct()
                                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.printf("Original List : %s,  Square Without duplicates : %s %n",
                                        numbers, distinct);

Output :
Original List : [9, 10, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4],  
Square Without duplicates : [81, 100, 9, 16, 49]

S/T
* The designer that was assigned to the project was very talented, but unfortunately missed a deadline that I assigned. When I approached him about it, he blew up at me.
A
* I was taken aback by his response, but I remained calm. I acknowledged that the deadlines were tight and explained again the reasoning and the importance of having the brochure ready for the trade show.
* He relaxed a little when he saw that I wasn’t attacking him. He told me about all of his other competing projects and how overwhelmed he was. I asked him if there was any way that I could help him come up with a solution.
* Eventually, we agreed that it would help if his manager had a better understanding of how important and time-consuming this project was. We decided we would speak with her together.
* She ended up assigning some of his other projects to another designer, which took some of the pressure off of him.
R
* We successfully completed the brochure in time for the trade show and received numerous compliments from both our own sales reps and potential customers.


Couldn’t meet the deadline
- [ ] I was once given a deadline to produce an article for a client on a short turnaround time. 
- [ ] I believed I could handle the article in addition to the workload I already had, but I miscalculated how long it would take me to write it. The morning the article was due, I realized I would not make it in time and contacted my boss to explain the situation. I apologized, explained what happened and asked for an extension, which he granted. 
- [ ] I learned that I need to be honest with myself about the workload I can handle each day. I also learned that when accepting assignments, I need to include a time buffer to ensure that even if unforeseen events arise, I am able to meet my deadlines.
- [ ] 

“Generally, I’m pretty adaptable. However, I think I would struggle if I were working for a manager that didn’t provide constructive feedback. I believe that feedback is an opportunity to learn and grow, but it can only serve that function if it is actionable and can help me enhance my capabilities. As a result, a manager that prefers to berate over being supportive is not ideal for me.”


Don’t share important project updates on Slack instead send it in email and try to consolidate as much information as possible.

Can we not make it a switch and enable the feature later in production

**Raw negotiation notes**
Jeff Orac

In any case, just say no. You're not obligated to provide anything to them. Be "above" this level of petty nickel and diming. "I'm not necessarily looking for a signing bonus of a specific amount to offset some lost options, I'm trying to give you an idea of the financial calculus going on in my head so that you can make me an attractive offer"

Say you don't feel comfortable giving out screenshots of your financial accounts.


Blind: 330 is top of ic3
Feb 23

2. Always act as if you are very happy in your current job and you are NOT desperately looking for a change.
My market value is higher than what is offered to me.
I don’t want to be at loss, by accepting 
Whats the salary band for this position.
Tell them that ultimately choosing a job is not an easy decision because it impacts your life so you can't take it lightly.

Please let me know if the comp is sounds right.
Base 180k
Rsu 8000 numbers ~ 320k over 4 years
Joining: 10k
NO CASH BONUSES AT YEAR END. I was told oracle doesn’t do annual cash bonuses instead they give rsus. Is that true?!

Don’t become emotional. Always be polite and appreciative, even when things might get heated or tense. When asking for more money, rejecting an offer, or disagreeing with your recruiter, you need to remain polite. 
Deferring is one way to keep calm and collected, and let the emotions subside so that cooler heads can prevail later.. For example, if a recruiter asks if you would accept an amount that you find offensive, just pause. Breathe. Then say “I will have to think about that, is it alright if I get back to you on it tomorrow?”

Always be enthusiastic about the opportunity at hand, the company, and the team. Maybe you might be displeased by the offer, but limit that displeasure to the offer details. Show that you are willing to play ball, that you are serious about the job offer, and that only the compensation is holding you back from accepting. 

I know XYZ is a very competitive company, and can definitely try to get this working.
Always have a human connection with the recruiter.
Jeff, if you really see, I am not making any good progress by accepting this offer, I am taking a bigger risk for just a few percent raise.
However, I am sure YOU can work something out.
Silicon Valley is super expensive, “I really want to buy a house within the next year; what can we do to improve the salary?” 
I would definitely want to keep interviewing otherwise, I am happy where I am currently at.
I know that you guys are looking for someone to build out your Android team. I believe I bring a lot of experience leading a team of Android developers and I’m confident that I’ll be able to bring your mobile offerings up to parity with your competitors.

“That makes sense. Unfortunately I can’t commit to signing yet; I’m not yet at the stage where I can make a final decision. Like I told you before, this weekend I’m going to sit down with my family and talk things over with them. Choosing the company I’m going to spend the next few years at is a commitment I take really seriously. So I want to be sure I’m making a well-considered decision.

This deadline also lets you defer your decision while still improving offers. Your narrative should basically be “I want to see the strongest offer your company can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, and when I emerge I will have decided in my heart which company to join.” This gives you enormous power to avoid any on-the-spot decision points or premature promises.


When you write this type of email or make this type of call, here’s what you want to get across:
* 		you’re really excited about their company and they are your number one choice
* 		however, you have another offer that you need to make a decision on
* 		you need to make this decision by x date
* 		you’d like to know how much information they can give you on your candidacy and next steps
* 		(that’s pretty much it!)
*
