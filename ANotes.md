**Learning from Last year:**

1. Book losses if you can, that could bring down the taxable amount by 3000 USD
2. Aptive, this was a immature and compulsive decision taken when the salesman was at our door. Costed us approximately 400 USD.
3. Try not to book tickets through Europe / Canada they do have restrictions on expired H1B and no VISA stamping.
4. You can do better tax savings, if you put your money towards retirement, in that calendar year.

Example for distinct

Example 9: Creating a Sub List by Copying distinct values 
This example shows how you can take advantage of a distinct() method of Stream class to filter duplicates in Collection.

// Create List of square of all distinct numbers
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(9, 10, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4);
List<Integer> distinct = numbers.stream()
                                      .map( i -> i*i)
                                      .distinct()
                                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.printf("Original List : %s,  Square Without duplicates : %s %n",
                                        numbers, distinct);

Output :
Original List : [9, 10, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4],  
Square Without duplicates : [81, 100, 9, 16, 49]

STAR - Conflict https://biginterview.com/behavioral-interview-questions-conflict/
S/T
* The designer that was assigned to the project was very talented, but unfortunately missed a deadline that I assigned. When I approached him about it, he blew up at me.
A
* I was taken aback by his response, but I remained calm. I acknowledged that the deadlines were tight and explained again the reasoning and the importance of having the brochure ready for the trade show.
* He relaxed a little when he saw that I wasn’t attacking him. He told me about all of his other competing projects and how overwhelmed he was. I asked him if there was any way that I could help him come up with a solution.
* Eventually, we agreed that it would help if his manager had a better understanding of how important and time-consuming this project was. We decided we would speak with her together.
* She ended up assigning some of his other projects to another designer, which took some of the pressure off of him.
R
* We successfully completed the brochure in time for the trade show and received numerous compliments from both our own sales reps and potential customers.


Couldn’t meet the deadline
- [ ] I was once given a deadline to produce an article for a client on a short turnaround time. 
- [ ] I believed I could handle the article in addition to the workload I already had, but I miscalculated how long it would take me to write it. The morning the article was due, I realized I would not make it in time and contacted my boss to explain the situation. I apologized, explained what happened and asked for an extension, which he granted. 
- [ ] I learned that I need to be honest with myself about the workload I can handle each day. I also learned that when accepting assignments, I need to include a time buffer to ensure that even if unforeseen events arise, I am able to meet my deadlines.
- [ ] 

“Generally, I’m pretty adaptable. However, I think I would struggle if I were working for a manager that didn’t provide constructive feedback. I believe that feedback is an opportunity to learn and grow, but it can only serve that function if it is actionable and can help me enhance my capabilities. As a result, a manager that prefers to berate over being supportive is not ideal for me.”


Don’t share important project updates on Slack instead send it in email and try to consolidate as much information as possible.

Can we not make it a switch and enable the feature later in production
